the current capabilities.

## Active Issues

### ISSUE-001 — Gerbonara provenance granularity is unverified

- Status: OPEN
- Severity: medium
- Owner: unassigned
- State label: `[CONFIRMED]`
- Context: The selected parser exposes graphical objects but source line/byte
  spans must be verified before they can be attached to findings.
- Evidence: Gerbonara adapter probe has not yet been implemented.
- Suspected cause: The third-party object API may not retain source spans.
- Attempted approaches: None.
- Current resolution state: Track source file and stable object IDs first;
  later add a lightweight command-span scanner without duplicating geometry
  parsing.
- Remaining work: Add frozen fixtures and verify span mapping.
- Relevant files: `IMPLEMENT_PCB_AGENT.md`
- Blocking: No; missing spans must remain explicit `null`.

## Next Action

Implement the Excellon parser adapter and lightweight command-span scanner.

Start with:

- `src/boardgate/parsers/excellon.py`
- `src/boardgate/parsers/scanner.py`
- `tests/fixtures/parser/excellon/`
- `tests/unit/parsers/test_excellon.py`

Acceptance criteria:

1. Gerbonara remains behind the adapter and no third-party object escapes.
2. Metric/inch, zero suppression, tool definitions, absolute round hits, and
   routed slots normalize to millimetres with provenance.
3. Slots remain separate from round-hole checks.
4. Parser warnings and unsupported commands become typed limitations.
5. Lightweight byte/line spans attach to commands without duplicating geometry
   parsing.
6. Golden, malformed-input, and round-trip tests pass before a separate commit.

  - Preserved all candidate evidence and emitted FILE_TYPE_UNKNOWN uncertainty
    for conflict or insufficient evidence.

- Evidence: Commands and results above.
- Commit: `d2198d3 feat(ingestion): classify files and build manifests`
- Issues created or updated: ISSUE-003 was not required; ambiguous `.txt`
  drill inputs are resolved only when Excellon content evidence is strong.
- Remaining uncertainty: The public inspect command does not yet emit a
  manifest.
- Recommended next action: Add atomic CLI manifest output.
