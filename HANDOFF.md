the current capabilities.

## Active Issues

### ISSUE-001 — Gerbonara provenance granularity is unverified

- Status: OPEN
- Severity: medium
- Owner: unassigned
- State label: `[CONFIRMED]`
- Context: The selected parser exposes graphical objects but source line/byte
  spans must be verified before they can be attached to findings.
- Evidence: Gerbonara adapter probe has not yet been implemented.
- Suspected cause: The third-party object API may not retain source spans.
- Attempted approaches: None.
- Current resolution state: Track source file and stable object IDs first;
  later add a lightweight command-span scanner without duplicating geometry
  parsing.
- Remaining work: Add frozen fixtures and verify span mapping.
- Relevant files: `IMPLEMENT_PCB_AGENT.md`
- Blocking: No; missing spans must remain explicit `null`.

## Next Action

Implement the versioned manufacturing Rule Profile and its restricted
YAML/JSON loader.

Start with:

- `src/boardgate/config/models.py`
- `src/boardgate/config/loader.py`
- `rules/default.yaml`
- `schemas/v1/`

Acceptance criteria:

1. Schema version `1.0` expresses required layers, all rule settings,
   manufacturing thresholds, tolerance, severity, and readiness effects.
2. YAML is limited to 1 MiB, one document, no aliases/anchors/custom tags,
   and no YAML 1.1 `yes/no/on/off` implicit booleans.
3. JSON and YAML produce the same strict model and deterministic profile hash.
4. Draft 2020-12 schemas for public boundary models are exported and validate
   representative artifacts.
5. Invalid configuration fails with typed, source-safe diagnostics.
6. The complete quality gate passes before a separate commit.

    stalled, then resolved and installed the locked project dependencies.
- Files modified:
  - Existing specification files added unchanged to Git tracking.
  - Repository documentation and configuration.

    — 1 passed, 100% coverage.
- Findings:
  - The source directory initially contained only the two specification files.
- Evidence:
  - GitHub returned `visibility: PUBLIC`.
  - Remote URL is `https://github.com/MattSureham/BoardGate`.
  - Python runtime is CPython 3.12.13.
  - `uv.lock` resolves 50 packages.
- Commit: `e5b9c63 docs: establish PCB agent implementation baseline`
- Issues created or updated: ISSUE-001
- Remaining uncertainty: Gerbonara source-span behavior remains unverified.
- Recommended next action: Implement strict geometry and provenance models.
