the current capabilities.

## Active Issues

### ISSUE-001 — Gerbonara provenance granularity is unverified

- Status: OPEN
- Severity: medium
- Owner: unassigned
- State label: `[CONFIRMED]`
- Context: The selected parser exposes graphical objects but source line/byte
  spans must be verified before they can be attached to findings.
- Evidence: Gerbonara adapter probe has not yet been implemented.
- Suspected cause: The third-party object API may not retain source spans.
- Attempted approaches: None.
- Current resolution state: Track source file and stable object IDs first;
  later add a lightweight command-span scanner without duplicating geometry
  parsing.
- Remaining work: Add frozen fixtures and verify span mapping.
- Relevant files: `IMPLEMENT_PCB_AGENT.md`
- Blocking: No; missing spans must remain explicit `null`.

## Next Action

Implement deterministic content-aware classification and manifest generation.

Start with:

- `src/boardgate/ingestion/hashing.py`
- `src/boardgate/ingestion/classifier.py`
- `src/boardgate/ingestion/manifest.py`
- `tests/unit/ingestion/`

Acceptance criteria:

1. Every staged file receives SHA-256, stable source ID, sorted candidates,
   confidence, and concrete evidence.
2. X2 hints, content signatures, file names, and extensions remain separate
   evidence; conflicts remain uncertain instead of being overwritten.
3. Gerber, Excellon, BOM/placement CSV, XLSX, rule files, and unknown inputs
   are classified conservatively.
4. The project ID is stable across directory/ZIP/file input forms.
5. Manifest JSON validates against the checked-in schema and is byte-stable.
6. Golden and ambiguity tests pass before a separate commit.

  2020-12.
